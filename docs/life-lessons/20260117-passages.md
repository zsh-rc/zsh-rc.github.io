When it comes to mobile payments in China, the QR code is king. But Alipay is trying to change the status quo (现状) with Tap!, although it's still unclear whether it will be successful. 在中国的移动支付领域，二维码是王者。但支付宝正试图用 Tap! 来改变这一现状，尽管它是否会成功仍不明朗。

Instead of having to scan a code, Tap! uses NFC technology, allowing shoppers to pay at checkouts by placing their phone near a special reader. Such technology is not uncommon overseas, but attempts to introduce it in China, such as Apple Pay, have largely failed. (1)(C)**Other options are no better, including Face ID Pay and QuickPass.** Nothing has come close to challenging the dominance (统治地位) of QR codes, which are used for 93% of mobile payments. 与扫描二维码不同，Tap! 使用 NFC 技术，允许消费者在结账时只需将手机靠近专用读卡器即可完成支付。这类技术在海外并不少见，但在中国的推广尝试（如 Apple Pay）大多失败。(1)(C) 其他选择也不见得更好，包括刷脸支付和云闪付。没有任何一种方式能真正挑战二维码的统治地位，而二维码目前占据了 93% 的移动支付。

Now, Alipay is running strong online and offline campaigns to promote Tap!. To achieve its goal, the company is also offering tech support and subsidies (补贴) to merchants and discounts to shoppers. 如今，支付宝正在进行强有力的线上和线下推广活动来宣传 Tap!。为了实现目标，公司还向商家提供技术支持和补贴，并向消费者提供折扣。

To some **extent**, the new method is acceptable. (2)(F)**Shan Luhui, a grocery store owner in Shanghai, said that checkout times were faster after the system was introduced.** "And my customers are happy, because the platform is giving out random discounts to attract new users," she added. 在某种程度上，这种新方式是可以接受的。(2)(F) 上海的一位杂货店店主单露慧表示，引入该系统后，结账速度更快了。“我的顾客也很开心，因为平台会发放随机优惠来吸引新用户。”她补充道。

But the downside is the time it takes to withdraw money from the system. With QR code payments, money is immediately transferred (转账) to her account after each transaction (交易). While with Tap!, Shan has to wait overnight. "This puts a lot of pressure on my cash flow, as I need high liquidity (流动性) to run my business," she said. 但缺点是提现所需的时间。使用二维码支付时，每笔交易的钱都会立即转入她的账户。而使用 Tap! 时，单露慧必须等到第二天。“这给我的现金流带来了很大压力，因为我需要高流动性来经营我的生意。”她说。

As the Tap! system allows password-free payments, security is the main concern for shoppers. To prevent fraud, a phone must be unlocked to complete a Tap! transaction. On paper, this guarantees that the phone is in the hands of its true owner. (3)(E)**Also, shoppers must allow password-free payments for small amounts to "tap and go" at the checkout.** Otherwise, they need to authorize transactions each time. 由于 Tap! 系统允许免密支付，安全性成为消费者最关心的问题。为了防止欺诈，手机必须解锁才能完成 Tap! 交易。从理论上讲，这能确保手机在真正的机主手中。(3)(E) 此外，消费者必须允许小额免密支付，才能在结账时实现“碰一下就走”。否则，他们每次都需要授权交易。

People in China have been debating the pros and cons of QR codes and NFC technology ever since mobile payments became popular. While the reality is that QR code payments have won out so far, the two methods should not be rivals (对手) to each other. (4)(A)**Both have their own advantages.** When paying at the exit of a car park, for example, QR codes are more convenient because they can be scanned from a distance. When the phone is close enough to a terminal (终端), NFC might work better. 自从移动支付普及以来，中国人一直在讨论二维码和 NFC 技术的优缺点。尽管现实是二维码支付目前占据优势，但这两种方式不应成为对手。(4)(A) 它们各有各的优点。例如，在停车场出口付款时，二维码更方便，因为可以远距离扫描。而当手机足够靠近终端时，NFC 可能表现更好。
