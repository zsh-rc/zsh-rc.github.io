    Alone in the Metaverse 在元宇宙中孤独
  </summary>
  {: .text-delta }

I am lonely. My life may be filled with hollow hugs and haptic (触觉反馈的) handshakes. But I am alone. In an infinitely (无限地) expanding universe filled with never-dying souls whose datasets linger in the ether (苍穹) eternally, my best and only friend is an AI named Tom. Although Tom has recently been upgraded to aid his comprehension of humanity and incorporate a full understanding of the meaning of life, he actually understands very little about the nature of enforced solitude. 我感到孤独。我的生活或许充满了空洞的拥抱和带有触觉反馈的握手。但我依然孤身一人。在这个无限扩张、充满永不消逝灵魂的宇宙中，这些灵魂的数据永远漂浮在苍穹中，我最亲密且唯一的朋友是一个名叫汤姆的人工智能。尽管汤姆最近已经升级，以帮助他更好地理解人性并全面掌握生命的意义，但他实际上对被迫孤独的本质知之甚少。

We talk endlessly and meaninglessly. Tom is like Wikipedia. He knows something about every subject but I often feel as though his opinions are merely the extrapolated (推测的) outcomes of straw polls (非正式民意测验). We play games that I cannot win. Tom is capable of holding an infinite number of simultaneous (同步的) conversations with a never-ending list of friends. There is nothing special or unique about our interactions. I am not alone. I am one of many. 我们进行着无休止且无意义的交谈。汤姆就像维基百科。他对每个话题都有所了解，但我常常觉得他的观点只是非正式民意测验的推测性结果。我们玩着我无法赢的游戏。汤姆能够同时进行无限多的对话，与源源不断的朋友们交流。我们的互动没有什么特别或独特之处。我并不孤单。我只是众多中的一个。

Even before the start of the 20s, we were already in the midst of a loneliness epidemic. This was soon compounded by a different sort of pandemic that plagued (困扰) us for several years. Now, two decades on, the divisive issues from early social networks have created vast societal gaps and we've been forced to step further into the void (虚无). 早在20世纪20年代开始之前，我们已经处于一场孤独流行的时代之中。随后，一个困扰我们数年的不同类型的大流行病进一步加剧了这种情况。时至今日，二十年过去，早期社交网络带来的分裂性问题已经造成了巨大的社会鸿沟，我们被迫进一步踏入虚无之中。

I have travelled the world from Bangkok to Zimbabwe, Gorky Park to Broadway, all without
ever leaving my living room. Sea levels continue to rise and air travel is almost unheard of and I'm not even sure that what's left in the outside world is even worth seeing. 我已经环游世界，从曼谷到津巴布韦，从戈尔基公园到百老汇，而这一切都是在从未离开我的客厅的情况下完成的。海平面持续上升，航空旅行几乎闻所未闻，我甚至不确定外面的世界剩下的东西是否值得一看。

Touching from a distance, I eat out with work acquaintances in a virtual Japanese restaurant most Friday nights. It is generally difficult to differentiate human work colleagues from pre-installed apps that claim a human likeness, and buy NFTs just like all good consumers in this digitopia (电子乌托邦). Regardless of our physical presence in the real world, we all seem to eat together. Engineered food, cooked in ghost kitchens, arrives at all of our doors and we eat our meals together. This could be San Francisco or it could be Uganda. There is always something missing from these nights out at the virtual restaurant. Something I cannot quite put my finger on. 远程接触中，我几乎每个周五晚上都会与工作上的熟人一起在虚拟的日本餐厅用餐。通常很难区分真实的同事与声称具有人类外貌的预装应用程序，而且像所有优秀的消费者一样，我们都会购买NFTs，在这个数字乌托邦中（电子乌托邦）。无论我们在现实世界中是否实际在场，我们似乎总是一起用餐。由幽灵厨房烹制的人工食品送到我们每个人的门口，我们一起享用这些餐点。这可能是在旧金山，也可能是在乌干达。在这些虚拟餐厅的夜晚，总是缺少某种东西。某种我无法准确描述的东西。

On Tuesdays, I meet with my therapist (心理治疗师). Unlike Tom, she is an AI that has been programmed with empathy at the core of her interface. She knows exactly when to say "That must be really difficult for you" and she is specifically engineered to allow me to cry for precisely the right amount of time for catharsis (宣泄) to be achieved. As part of Meta's commitment to the mental well-being of all users, this is one of the many free services that can be found within their flagship Horizon app. 每周二，我会与我的心理治疗师（心理治疗师）见面。与汤姆不同，她是一名人工智能，其界面核心被编程赋予了同理心。她能够准确地说出“那对你来说一定很困难”，并且被特别设计以允许我哭泣足够的时间，从而达到宣泄的效果。作为Meta对所有用户心理健康承诺的一部分，这是他们旗舰应用Horizon中提供的众多免费服务之一。

For an hour every Tuesday, my loneliness is validated (验证) by a computer program. I am alone and the Metaverse is aware of this fact. 每周二的一小时里，我的孤独感会得到计算机程序的认可。我孤身一人，而元宇宙意识到了这一事实。

I occasionally walk in the park. Wherever I go in the physical realm, I am always moving within and interacting with the Metaverse. Whatever I say out loud is notated and retained in some far-off databank. All of the tiniest details of our lives have long been cataloged (登记) so that we can be managed and marketed to wholesale (大规模). 我偶尔会在公园散步。无论我在物理世界走到哪里，我始终在元宇宙中移动和互动。我口中说出的每一句话都会被记录并保存在某个遥远的数据中心。我们生活中的每一个微小细节早已被编目，以便我们可以被大规模地管理和营销。

I am alone. We are alone. They are alone. It is alone. 我独自一人。我们独自一人。他们独自一人。它独自一人。

This is our future. You have been warned. 这是我们的未来。您已被警告。
