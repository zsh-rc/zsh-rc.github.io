    Xiexiu: Beyond Wuxia, Into Life 邪修：超越武侠，走进生活
  </summary>
  {: .text-delta }

Picture yourself as the hero in a Chinese martial-arts novel. Intent on honing (磨炼) your powers or perhaps attaining immortality, there are two paths available to you. Do you choose zhengxiu, the orthodox (正统的) one that typically demands decades of meditation (打坐) in a cave? Or do you risk xiexiu, the heretical (异教的) way? It is swifter. But it also involves moral compromise. In the novels, those who opt for the latter usually end up either corrupt or dead. Traditional mores (传统习俗) warn against those who cheat established systems. 想象自己成为一部中国武侠小说中的英雄。你决心磨炼自己的功力，或者追求长生不老，现在有两条道路可供选择。你会选择正统的正修吗？通常这条路需要在山洞中打坐数十年。还是你会冒险选择异教的邪修之路？它速度更快，但也意味着道德上的妥协。在小说中，选择后者的人通常最终要么堕落，要么死去。传统习俗警告人们不要欺骗既定的体系。

But xiexiu has acquired a new lease of life among certain youngsters. Detached from its literary origins, it now denotes (表示) a departure from the proper way: more efficient, more creative or simply less bound by convention (惯例). In recent months videos tagged with the term have drawn billions of views on Douyin and Xiaohongshu, a pair of social platforms. Businesses have joined the fun, selling products in strange combinations. Some departures are just rebranded life hacks (生活技巧), such as rendering lard (熬猪油) in a microwave or learning English through fan fiction. Others veer (转向) into the absurd: reading advanced mathematics as a cure for insomnia (失眠), dining in the nude to shame oneself into getting in shape or melting ice cream to make carbonara sauce (一种意大利面酱). 但谢修在一些年轻人中获得了新生。脱离了其文学起源，它现在表示一种偏离正道的行为：更高效、更具创意，或者只是少受惯例束缚。近几个月，带有该词标签的视频在抖音和小红书这两个社交平台上吸引了数十亿的观看。企业也加入了这股热潮，销售一些奇怪组合的产品。有些偏离只是重新包装的生活技巧，例如用微波炉熬猪油或通过同人小说学习英语。其他的则走向荒诞：通过阅读高等数学来治疗失眠、裸身用餐以逼自己锻炼身材，或者将冰淇淋融化来制作意大利面酱碳ara。

Many of those embracing the trend are young adults, who see xiexiu as a middle path between striving hard ("996" office culture) and "lying flat" (resigning oneself to dull employment to avoid intolerable stress). More than a shortcut, xiexiu signals disillusionment (醒悟). When young people face the usual hurdles (难关) of stepping into adulthood, such as balancing life's demands and future prospects, they often seek options that suit their needs better. That's why xiexiu becomes a choice for some. 许多接受这一趋势的人是年轻人，他们将“躺休”视为努力奋斗（“996”办公文化）与“躺平”（为了避免难以承受的压力而甘于平淡工作）之间的一条中间道路。躺休不仅仅是一种捷径，它还意味着迷茫和觉醒（醒悟）。当年轻人面对步入成年所遇到的常见难关（难关），例如平衡生活的需求与未来的前景时，他们往往会寻找更适合自己需求的选择。这也是为什么躺休会成为一些人的选择。

Last month, the social account of Guangming Daily declared the fad (一时的潮流) a cheerful way for the young to counter (反驳) uncertainty and gain initiative. The commentary stopped short of calling it a rebellion, instead describing it as "a way to seek improvement". Easier perhaps, to let the young channel their anxiety through quirky (古怪的) hacks than to focus on the more complicated aspects of what lies ahead. But an inclination towards xiexiu should not be dismissed. "Heretical practice isn't really about teaching you how to cook，it's teaching you how to rethink," reads one clear-eyed comment. 上个月，《光明日报》的社交账号称这种潮流是一种让年轻人以愉快方式应对不确定性并获得主动权的方式。评论没有直接称其为叛逆，而是把它描述为“寻求进步的一种方式”。或许，让年轻人通过古怪的小技巧来纾解焦虑，比让他们关注未来更复杂的方面来得容易。然而，对斜修的倾向不应被忽视。一条清晰的评论写道：“异端的做法并不是真的教你如何烹饪，而是在教你如何重新思考。”
