Dear Badminton,

I do remember the days before we met. I came back to an empty home with nothing to look forward to. There were many nights when I would lie in bed wondering if I would ever find something as fulfilling as you. After years of nothing happening, you moved next door in the form of a court and threw your doors open for me to walk through. 我的确记得我们相遇之前的日子。我回到一个空荡荡的家，没有什么值得期待的。有许多个夜晚，我躺在床上，想知道我是否能找到像你一样充实的东西。多年后一事无成，你以球场的形式搬到了隔壁，向我敞开了大门，让我走进去。

My entire life, I never knew I would find such joy in spending time getting to know you. When I started this journey with you, I was obviously nervous but you were patient and let me try again and again. That is one thing I like about you—no matter how big a disappointment I might be in life, you give me a chance to be the best version of myself with you. I fail many times. I am out of breath. I run badly. I am weak in serving (发球). But even if I lose, you let me play again. When I’m too tired you tell me that it’s time for me to take a rest while also assuring me that you’ll be open tomorrow for me to come back and pick up wherever it was I left off. 我一生都不知道，花时间了解你竟能找到如此多的快乐。当我与你开始这段旅程时，我显然很紧张，但你很有耐心，让我一次又一次地尝试。这是我喜欢你的一点——无论我在生活中多么令人失望，你都给了我一个机会，让我与你一起成为最好的自己。我失败了很多次。我气喘吁吁。我跑得很糟糕。我发球很弱（发球）。但即使我输了，你还是让我再玩一次。当我太累时，你告诉我该休息了，同时也向我保证，明天你还会开放，让我回来继续我中断的地方。

There were times when I was just starting out where I’d think: Is this going to be another random hobby that I pursue only to give up after not making any progress? That has happened before. It happened while I was playing the piano. It happened while I was learning to make cheesecake. It happened while I was wanting to paint. 刚开始的时候，我有时会想：这会不会又是一个我追求了却没取得任何进展就放弃的随机爱好？以前就发生过这种情况。弹钢琴时发生过。学做芝士蛋糕时发生过。想画画时也发生过。

You make me want to be better. I wake up early to train. I put the right food into my body so that I stay healthy. I sleep well so that I feel rested. I practice so that I’m always prepared for a match whenever it should happen. I want to be a better person than the one I was yesterday. There’s a glow in my face and a light in my life. Every time I take a selfie, I see it and I am so thankful for how happy I feel. That happiness is why I want to spend my time with you. I’ll do my best to make you feel valued. I’ll do my best to be there for you as dependably solid as the rock you’ve been for me. I’ll not be able to explain to you how much I love you because you’re a sport. As a sport you don’t believe words or read letters. You only see actions, which is why I’ll walk the talk. 你让我想要变得更好。我早起训练。我吃正确的食物来保持健康。我睡得很好，以便感觉休息充分。我练习是为了随时为可能发生的比赛做好准备。我想成为比昨天更好的自己。我的脸上焕发着光彩，我的生活充满了光明。每次我自拍时，我都能看到这一点，我非常感谢我感受到的快乐。这种快乐就是我为什么想和你在一起的原因。我会尽力让你感到被重视。我会尽力为你坚如磐石，就像你对我一样可靠。我无法向你解释我有多爱你，因为你是一项运动。作为一项运动，你不相信文字，也不会读信。你只看行动，这就是为什么我将言出必行。

When I'm in the court and I see old people coming in with their inhalers (吸入器) to play, I suddenly have the answer to that question I have been asked so many times—"What do you want to be when you grow up?" I want to be there with you till the end. 当我在球场上，看到老人们带着他们的吸入器（inhalers）进来打球时，我突然有了那个被问过无数次的问题的答案——“你长大后想成为什么样的人？” 我想和你一起走到最后。

Love you always, 永远爱你，

Paul 保罗
