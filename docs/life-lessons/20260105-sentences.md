    Is truly open-source AI possible?
  </summary>
  {: .text-delta }

  There are two sides to the software industry. One faces outwards, with products and services generating billions for trillion-dollar companies. The other faces inwards, creating, updating and sharing—often for free—the basic software tools that make the digital world tick. 软件行业有两面性。一面朝外，产品和服务为万亿美元的公司创造数十亿美元的收入。另一面朝内，创造、更新和分享（通常是免费的）构成数字世界基础的软件工具。

  This second side is known as open-source software. It underpins (巩固) platforms like Google's Android, Apple's iOS, and major web browsers. By making software freely available, developers can strengthen their code through collaboration (合作), gain trust by proving its reliability and earn recognition from peers. Some open-source projects even make money by selling support to users of the free products. 这第二面被称为开源软件。它支撑着（巩固）谷歌的 Android、苹果的 iOS 和主要的网络浏览器等平台。通过免费提供软件，开发者可以通过协作（合作）来强化他们的代码，通过证明其可靠性来赢得信任，并获得同行的认可。一些开源项目甚至通过向免费产品的用户销售支持来赚钱。
  
  Unluckily, modern tech giants have stretched the term into meaninglessness. Many so-called "free" products are restricted, developed in secrecy and unable to bring about true innovation. This has led to a heated debate about the real meaning of open source in the age of AI. 不幸的是，现代科技巨头已经将这个词延伸到毫无意义的地步。许多所谓的“免费”产品受到限制，在秘密状态下开发，无法带来真正的创新。这引发了一场关于人工智能时代开源真正含义的激烈辩论。

  In traditional software, the term is well-defined. A developer lets others use their original lines of code written to create a piece of software. This allows any other developer to download, modify (修改) and repurpose the code. Typically, the original developer will ask for the modified version to be shared, too. Over time, original code can evolve into entirely new products. Android, for instance, is based on Linux, originally written for computers. 在传统软件中，这个术语有明确的定义。开发者允许其他人使用他们为创建软件而编写的原始代码行。这使得任何其他开发者都可以下载、修改（修改）和重新利用代码。通常，原始开发者会要求也分享修改后的版本。随着时间的推移，原始代码可以演变成全新的产品。例如，Android 就是基于最初为计算机编写的 Linux。
  
  Meta, the parent company of Facebook, proudly claims that its large language model (LLM), Llama 3, is "open source". However, the tech giant also places restrictions on its use, including a ban on using the model to build products with more than 700 million monthly active users. Other labs have also released LLMs for free use, but with similar limits. Facebook 的母公司 Meta 自豪地宣称其大型语言模型（LLM）Llama 3 是“开源”的。然而，这家科技巨头也对其使用施加了限制，包括禁止使用该模型构建每月活跃用户超过 7 亿的产品。其他实验室也发布了供免费使用的 LLM，但也有类似的限制。
  
  What Meta shares freely is the weights (权重) of the artificial neurons (人工神经元) in its LLM, rather than all the source code and training data. This is certainly not sufficient for someone to build their own version of Llama 3 from scratch. Unlike traditional software development, AI training involves creating a blueprint of the model and feeding it large amounts of data, which the system then uses to adjust its structure through a series of unpredictable steps. Over time, the model improves its performance to an acceptable level. Even if someone were to train an AI model using the same data and hardware as Llama 3, the result would not be identical. That limits the benefits of the open-source approach. While the code can be examined, there's no certainty that it will perform exactly as the original. Meta 免费分享的是其 LLM 中人工神经元（人工神经元）的权重（权重），而不是所有的源代码和训练数据。这对于某人从零开始构建自己的 Llama 3 版本来说绝对不够。与传统软件开发不同，人工智能训练涉及创建模型的蓝图，并向其输入大量数据，系统随后通过一系列不可预测的步骤使用这些数据来调整其结构。随着时间的推移，模型的性能会提高到可接受的水平。即使有人使用与 Llama 3 相同的数据和硬件来训练人工智能模型，结果也不会完全相同。这限制了开源方法的好处。虽然代码可以被检查，但不能确定它的性能会与原始版本完全一样。
  
  There are other challenges when it comes to truly open-source AI. Training a cutting-edge AI model that can compete with the latest releases from OpenAI or its peers, for example, costs at least $1 billion. This discourages the developers who have already spent a fortune from sharing. There are also safety concerns. The powerful models may be misused for dangerous purposes, such as spreading harmful content. 在实现真正的开源人工智能方面还存在其他挑战。例如，训练一个可以与 OpenAI 或其同行最新发布的产品竞争的尖端人工智能模型的成本至少为 10 亿美元。这阻碍了已经花费巨资的开发者进行分享。还存在安全隐患。强大的模型可能被滥用用于危险目的，例如传播有害内容。
